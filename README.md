Exploring AI and ML Trends through Topic Modeling      
In today's fast-growing fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it's important to keep up with the latest trends. This project helps researchers, academic scholars, and companies understand what's new and where to focus their efforts. By using topic modeling, a method of finding key themes in large amounts of text, we can spot what topics are popular in AI and ML right now. This is really useful for researchers who want to find new areas to study, and for companies deciding where to invest.Our project uses advanced language processing techniques to analyze a lot of data from different scientific areas. We combine older methods with a newer approach called BERTopic to get a deeper understanding of these trends. This way, we can provide valuable insights for people working in AI and ML, helping them make informed decisions and plan future research.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, MS PowerPoint

Overview: Developed a topic modeling system utilizing NLP techniques to analyze trends within a dataset comprising 2 million records in the domains of AI and ML. Employed LSA, LDA, and BERTopic methodologies to identify emerging trends. Created engaging visualizations aimed at aiding researchers, policymakers, and academic funders to gain a deeper understanding of the past landscape in AI and ML research.
